Use the command `tree` to get an understanding of the project structure.

Start with reading the CLAUDE.md file if it exists to get an understanding of the project.

Read the README.md file to get an understanding of the project.

IMPORTANT: Use Serena to search through the code base. If you get any errors using Serena, retry with different Serena tools.
IMPORTANT: Use context7 if you neet to know how a library is used. In context7 you have a lot of libraries with their documentation.

Read key files in the src/ or root directory

Explain back to me:
